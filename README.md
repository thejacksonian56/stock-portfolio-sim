# stock-portfolio-sim
A simulated stock portfolio manager made for an MSSA project

This program allows the user to create and manage local stock portfolios in a sandbox enviornment. In it's current state, it doesn't accuratly reflect the rules of the stock market, and shouldn't be used for anything other than personal use. This program was developed in C# and with the Finnhub.io stock API.

## Running the program
Once the project has been downloaded, it can be executed by navigating to the /bin/Debug/net5.0/ and running StockProjectTest.exe
